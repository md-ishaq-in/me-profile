### <strong>1. What is Docker?</strong>


<strong>Docker</strong> is an open-source platform that helps developers and DevOps engineers <strong>build, ship, and run applications inside containers</strong>. A container is a lightweight, portable, and isolated environment that contains everything an application needs to run—such as code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies—allowing it to work consistently across different environments (development, staging, production).


### Why Containers?

- <strong>Portability</strong>: Docker ensures that an application runs the same, no matter where it’s deployed.
- <strong>Efficiency</strong>: Containers are lightweight and share the host OS’s kernel, making them faster and more efficient than traditional virtual machines (VMs).
- <strong>Scalability</strong>: Containers can be scaled easily to handle more traffic, making them ideal for microservices architecture and cloud-native applications.

### <strong>Quiz for You!</strong>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the key advantage of Docker containers in terms of application portability?</strong></summary>

- A) They run different versions of the same application simultaneously.

- B) They ensure the application runs consistently across different environments.

- C) They allow users to run multiple operating systems at once.

_(Answer : C)_


</details>


---


### <strong>2. Why Docker for DevOps?</strong>


In DevOps, speed, automation, and consistency are critical for achieving continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD). Docker offers several benefits:

- <strong>Isolation</strong>: Each container runs independently, which prevents conflicts between applications.
- <strong>Rapid Deployment</strong>: Docker containers start up quickly, making deployment faster than with virtual machines.
- <strong>Consistency</strong>: Docker ensures that your applications work the same across different environments (dev, staging, production), minimizing the “works on my machine” issue.

By using Docker, DevOps teams can streamline workflows, automate processes, and increase development speed.


### <strong>Quiz for You!</strong>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does Docker enhance the speed of deployments in DevOps?</strong></summary>

- A) Containers boot faster than virtual machines.

- B) Docker uses virtual machines for faster deployment.

- C) Docker deploys applications without using an OS kernel.

_(Answer: A)_


</details>

### <strong>3. Docker vs. Virtual Machines</strong>


While Docker and virtual machines both help in running applications in isolated environments, they have key differences.


| <strong>Docker (Containers)</strong>             | <strong>Virtual Machines</strong>                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Uses containers to run apps         | Uses virtual machines with a full OS      |
| Shares host OS kernel (lightweight) | Each VM has its own OS (heavier)          |
| Starts in seconds                   | Takes minutes to boot                     |
| Efficient resource usage            | More resource-intensive                   |
| Ideal for microservices and CI/CD   | Good for running multiple OS environments |

### <strong>7. Dockerfiles: Building Your Own Docker Image</strong>


A <strong>Dockerfile</strong> is a text file that contains instructions on how to build a Docker image. It specifies the base image, environment variables, dependencies, and application code that will be included in the container.


### <strong>Writing a Dockerfile</strong>


Here’s an example of a simple <strong>Dockerfile</strong> for a Node.js application:


<div class="code-block-wrapper">
  <pre><code class="language-text">\# Use the official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:14

\# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

\# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install

\# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

\# Expose the app's port
EXPOSE 3000

\# Start the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]</code><button class="copy-button">Copy</button></pre>
</div>


### <strong>Steps in a Dockerfile</strong>:

1. <strong>FROM</strong>: Specifies the base image (in this case, <code class="inline-code">node:14</code>).
2. <strong>WORKDIR</strong>: Sets the working directory inside the container.
3. <strong>COPY</strong>: Copies files from your local machine to the container.
4. <strong>RUN</strong>: Runs a command (e.g., <code class="inline-code">npm install</code>) inside the container.
5. <strong>EXPOSE</strong>: Opens a port (3000 in this case) to allow communication with the container.
6. <strong>CMD</strong>: Specifies the command that will run when the container starts.

### Building a Docker Image:


<div class="code-block-wrapper">
  <pre><code class="language-shell">docker build -t myapp:latest .</code><button class="copy-button">Copy</button></pre>
</div>


This command builds the Docker image from the Dockerfile in the current directory and tags it as <code class="inline-code">myapp:latest</code>.


### <strong>Quiz for You!</strong>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the purpose of the</strong> <strong><code class="inline-code">FROM</code></strong> <strong>instruction in a Dockerfile?</strong></summary>

- A) To create a new directory inside the container.

- B) To specify the base image from which to build the container.

- C) To run commands inside the container.

_(Answer: B)_


</details>


---


### <strong>8. Docker Networking</strong>


<strong>Docker Networking</strong> enables communication between containers and the outside world or between containers in a cluster. Docker automatically sets up a <strong>bridge network</strong> for containers by default.


### Creating a Custom Network:


<div class="code-block-wrapper">
  <pre><code class="language-shell">docker network create my-network</code><button class="copy-button">Copy</button></pre>
</div>


You can attach containers to this network:


<div class="code-block-wrapper">
  <pre><code class="language-shell">docker run -d --name web --network my-network nginx
docker run -d --name db --network my-network postgres</code><button class="copy-button">Copy</button></pre>
</div>


### Real-World Scenario:


You’re building a multi-tier application where a <strong>web container</strong> (NGINX) and a <strong>database container</strong> (Postgres) need to communicate. By attaching them to the same network (<code class="inline-code">my-network</code>), they can communicate using their container names as hostnames.


### <strong>Quiz for You!</strong>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why would you create a custom Docker network?</strong></summary>

- A) To increase container resource usage.

- B) To enable containers to communicate with each other.

- C) To isolate containers from one another.

_(Answer: B)_


</details>


---


### <strong>9. Docker Volumes: Persistent Storage</strong>


Docker containers are typically <strong>stateless</strong>, meaning any data generated inside the container is lost when the container stops. <strong>Volumes</strong> provide a way to persist data by storing it outside the container.


### Creating a Volume:


<div class="code-block-wrapper">
  <pre><code class="language-shell">docker volume create my-volume</code><button class="copy-button">Copy</button></pre>
</div>


### Attaching a Volume to a Container:


<div class="code-block-wrapper">
  <pre><code class="language-shell">docker run -d -v my-volume:/app/data nginx</code><button class="copy-button">Copy</button></pre>
</div>


### Real-World Scenario:


You need to persist data (such as logs or database files) generated by an application inside the container. Using volumes, you ensure that the data remains available even if the container is stopped or removed.


### <strong>Quiz for You!</strong>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the purpose of Docker volumes?</strong></summary>

- A) To increase the CPU usage of containers.

- B) To persist data beyond the lifecycle of a container.

- C) To automatically replicate data between containers.

_(Answer: B)_


</details>


---


### <strong>10. Docker Compose</strong>


<strong>Docker Compose</strong> simplifies multi-container deployments. You define your services in a <code class="inline-code">docker-compose.yml</code> file, and Docker Compose brings them up with a single command.


### Example <code class="inline-code">docker-compose.yml</code>:


<div class="code-block-wrapper">
  <pre><code class="language-yaml">version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example

volumes:
  db-data:</code><button class="copy-button">Copy</button></pre>
</div>


### Starting the Application:


<div class="code-block-wrapper">
  <pre><code class="language-shell">docker-compose up -d</code><button class="copy-button">Copy</button></pre>
</div>


### Real-World Scenario:


You’re deploying an NGINX web server and a Postgres database as part of a development environment. Instead of running multiple <code class="inline-code">docker run</code> commands, you define both services in a <code class="inline-code">docker-compose.yml</code> file and start them with one command.


### <strong>Quiz for You!</strong>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the advantage of using Docker Compose?</strong></summary>

- A) It only runs one container at a time.

- B) It allows for multi-container deployments with a single command.

- C) It increases the memory usage of containers.

_(Answer: B)_


</details>


---


### <strong>11. Docker Swarm: Orchestration Simplified</strong>


<strong>Docker Swarm</strong> is Docker’s native solution for orchestrating containers across multiple hosts. It simplifies tasks such as load balancing, service discovery, and scaling.


### Initializing a Docker Swarm:


<div class="code-block-wrapper">
  <pre><code class="language-shell">docker swarm init</code><button class="copy-button">Copy</button></pre>
</div>


### Adding Worker Nodes:


<div class="code-block-wrapper">
  <pre><code class="language-shell">docker swarm join --token <worker-token> <manager-ip></code><button class="copy-button">Copy</button></pre>
</div>


### Real-World Scenario:


You want to deploy a scalable application across multiple hosts. Using Docker Swarm, you can create a cluster of machines (nodes) that run containers. Docker Swarm will handle load balancing and service scaling for you.


### <strong>Quiz for You!</strong>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is Docker Swarm used for?</strong></summary>

- A) Managing and scaling containers across multiple hosts.
