### Cloud governance with Cloud Operations


Cloud Operations enables you to create custom policies to automate cost management, security concerns, and more. It works for public, private, hybrid cloud, and multicloud deployments — as well as containerized environments.


The tool enables you to contrast performance data with your provisioned capacity to pinpoint assets that you could scale down or terminate to reduce unnecessary spending.


You’ll get alerts when conditions diverge from your desired state. Fortunately, your custom policies can kick in immediately and start enabling automated actions that execute changes in your environment.
